Captain's Log Overview
- Captain's Log is an optional subsystem of Primus OS.
- It is intended for higher-privilege control, auditing, and operational notes.
- When inactive, Primus OS operates in normal mode.

Modes and Status
- Captain's Log has an "active" flag indicating whether it is currently engaged.
- When Captain's Log is active, Primus OS is considered to be in "captains_log" mode.
- When Captain's Log is not active, Primus OS is considered to be in "normal" mode.

CLI Integration
- The primary CLI command for Captain's Log is "cl".
- The "cl" command supports three conceptual actions:
  1) enter  - request entering Captain's Log Master Root Mode.
  2) exit   - request exiting Captain's Log Master Root Mode.
  3) status - show whether Captain's Log is currently active.
- The CLI is a thin wrapper; the real logic lives in the Captain's Log manager.

Manager Responsibilities
- The Captain's Log manager tracks whether Captain's Log is active.
- It may enforce additional checks or policies when active.
- It provides a method to query the current status of Captain's Log.

Testing Notes
- If a query asks "What modes can Primus OS report for Captain's Log?", the correct answers are "captains_log" and "normal".
- If a query asks "Which CLI command controls Captain's Log?", the correct answer is "cl".
- If a query asks "What does the 'status' action do in Captain's Log CLI?", the correct answer is "it reports whether Captain's Log is active or not".
