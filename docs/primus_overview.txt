PRIMUS OS is a local-first AI system focused on privacy, offline capability, and modular agents.
PrimusCore is the orchestration core that wires the model backend, sessions, and RAG together.
The ModelManager wraps llama.cpp GGUF models for offline text generation.
The SessionManager records multi-turn conversations when a session ID is provided.
Captain's Log Master Root Mode is isolated and private, used for secure journaling and diagnostics.
A SecurityGate layer reports whether network access should be allowed when Captain's Log is active.
RAG supports indexing your docs folder into searchable vectors for contextual answers.
Bootup self-tests confirm the runtime, model backend, and RAG wiring are operational.
