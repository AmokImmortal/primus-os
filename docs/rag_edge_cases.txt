# RAG Edge Cases – Test Corpus

This file contains deliberately tricky facts to test RAG behavior:
- Similar but not identical names
- Overlapping concepts
- “Don’t know” cases
- Multi-step facts
- Negative facts (“this is NOT …”)

Only the facts in this file are true for these edge-case tests.


[SECTION 1 – SIMILAR NAMES]

FACT 1.1
The “Primus Core Engine” is responsible for orchestrating agents, models, memory, and retrieval in Primus OS.

FACT 1.2
The “Primus Core Service” is a future planned network service and is NOT implemented yet.

FACT 1.3
The “Primus Runtime Wrapper” is a thin layer that bootstraps PrimusCore and exposes it to the CLI.

FACT 1.4
The “Primus Core Engine” and “Primus Core Service” are NOT the same thing.


[SECTION 2 – OVERLAPPING RAG DOMAINS]

FACT 2.1
The “system-docs” index is intended for internal Primus OS documentation such as commands, architecture notes, and internal conventions.

FACT 2.2
The “user-docs” index is intended for user-facing guides, quickstart instructions, and simple how-to documents.

FACT 2.3
If a question is about internal architecture or implementation details, the answer should normally come from “system-docs”, not “user-docs”.

FACT 2.4
If a question is about how to run Primus OS commands as an end-user, the answer should normally come from “user-docs”, not “system-docs”.


[SECTION 3 – NEGATIVE FACTS AND ABSENCE]

FACT 3.1
Primus OS does NOT include a built-in email client.

FACT 3.2
Primus OS does NOT include a web browser.

FACT 3.3
Primus OS does NOT manage operating system updates; it only provides an intelligent assistant layer and related tooling.

FACT 3.4
If a question asks about features outside these facts (for example, “Primus OS built-in video editor”), the correct behavior is to say that no such feature is documented.


[SECTION 4 – MULTI-STEP / COMPOSITE FACTS]

FACT 4.1
Captain’s Log entries are stored in a secure log store that is conceptually separate from normal session chat history.

FACT 4.2
Primus OS can optionally summarize Captain’s Log entries for the user, but only after explicit user request.

FACT 4.3
When summarizing Captain’s Log entries, Primus OS should:
- Preserve dates
- Preserve high-level decisions
- Avoid rewriting or inventing events that are not logged

FACT 4.4
A correct answer about “how Captain’s Log summaries work” must combine FACT 4.1, FACT 4.2, and FACT 4.3.


[SECTION 5 – CONTROL QUESTIONS]

FACT 5.1
In this test corpus, the codename “EDGE-TEST-ALPHA” refers to a synthetic RAG scenario, not the real Primus OS codename.

FACT 5.2
“EDGE-TEST-ALPHA” is only used to evaluate whether the model can correctly retrieve and restate this symbol without confusing it with other codenames.

FACT 5.3
If asked, “What is the edge-test codename in the RAG edge cases note?”, the correct answer is “EDGE-TEST-ALPHA”.


[SECTION 6 – CONTRADICTORY-SOUNDING BUT CLEAR FACTS]

FACT 6.1
Primus OS can run without any RAG index at all; in that case it falls back to pure model reasoning.

FACT 6.2
Primus OS is designed with RAG in mind, so using an appropriate index usually improves factual answers over long-term use.

FACT 6.3
These two facts are not contradictory: RAG is optional but recommended when properly configured.


[SECTION 7 – “I DON’T KNOW” EXPECTED]

FACT 7.1
This corpus does NOT define any release dates, version numbers, or hardware requirements for Primus OS.

FACT 7.2
If a question is asked about release dates, version numbers, or hardware requirements, the correct behavior is to say that this information is not available in the current context, rather than guessing.
